Report generated at 2026-01-16 08:12:33. This report is based on data collected by and exported from Umami analytics. The earliest record in this export is from 2025-10-09 05:52:20 while the latest record is from 2026-01-16 07:08:24. Detailed Umami analytics (i.e. including events and not just page views) was added for the public on 2025-12-13 09:30:00, so records from before then are dropped, even though they may have been valid user visits.
