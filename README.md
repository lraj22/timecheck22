# TimeCheck 22

Ever wondered how much time is left in your class period? What about that assembly schedule that no one exactly remembers?

Keeping track of school schedules can be confusing, especially when a special schedule is active and no one knows exactly when each period starts and ends. TimeCheck 22 is a clock website/app to enable students & teachers to easily and effectively use the customizable clock to track the time as it passes during school.

## What is context?

Context is any data that defines a school's real schedule, along with any related data. So, this would include the school's name and timezone, all the different schedules it follows (regular day, block A/B, minimum day, etc.), which days have which schedules, days that are exceptions, any active announcements, etc.

Context is curated by specially appointed students at each school! They update the context as necessary and it gets pushed to all the regular users of the clock.

You can find more information on what exactly context describes in the [Context documentation](./docs/Context.md).

## My school isn't on the list :[

This tool is being designed for students from schools around mine, so if you want your school added on this list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lraj22/timecheck22/issues/new/choose) and we can work on adding it!
