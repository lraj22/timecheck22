## What is context?

Context is any data that defines a school's real schedule, along with any related data. So, this would include the school's name and timezone, all the different schedules it follows (regular day, block A/B, minimum day, etc.), which days have which schedules, days that are exceptions, any active announcements, etc.

Context is curated by specially appointed students at each school! They update the context as necessary and it gets pushed to all the regular users of the clock.

You can find more information on what exactly context describes in the [Context documentation](./docs/Context.md).

## My school isn't on the list :[

This tool is being designed for students from schools around mine, so if you want your school added on this list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lraj22/timecheck22/issues/new/choose) and we can work on adding it! I will need to have at least one person willing to update context (this can be you!).
